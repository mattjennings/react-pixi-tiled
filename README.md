# react-pixi-tiled

A test project to try out react-pixi with tiled maps using Tiled

## Install

```
yarn
```

note: it uses a custom react-pixi build from my github in order to support Suspense, so it will install its dependencies & build react-pixi after it finishes. You will see an error about tests not being found, that's ok.

## Start

```
yarn dev
```
